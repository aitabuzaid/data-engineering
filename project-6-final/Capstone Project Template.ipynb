    "#### Project Summary\n",
    "This project uses immigration data to the United States, combined with three other data sources, namely, historical averages of weather temperatures, airports in the US, and demographics of US cities in order to create a data lake through Spark that is ready for analysis when required. The project will provide a data model in a star schema with one fact and three dimensional tables. "

    "#### Scope \n",
    "The project will combine four data sources: I94 Immigration Data, World Temperature Data, US City Demographic Data, and Airport Code Table. I will use Spark in order to build a data lake and model the data in a star schema, with the I94 immigration data as the fact table and all other data sources as the dimension tables. The tables will be saved as parquet files as the end solution will be a set of parquet files that can be loaded whenever a new analysis is needed by the Data Science team. The only tool that will be used in this project is Apache Spark. Amazon EMR and Apache Airflow will not be used in this project, however, the project can be extended later on to include these technologies once the processing requirements increase. \n",

    "The fact table is the immigration data from the US National Tourism and Trade Office, detailing the respondents information (people travelling into the US), while the dimension tables are as follows: the first provides the average temperature for cities in the world and it is provided by Kaggle datasets, the second provides detailed information about city airports in the US, and it is provided from DataHub, while the last provides further details about demographics in US cities, and it is provided from OpenSoft. The three data sets will be joined through taking cities as the primary key.\n",

    " -How does immigration differ in terms of visa type and the origin country? \n",

    "In this project, I chose to use Apache Spark for processing the data since I am planning to develope a data lake for others to use by loading data and analyizing it. Apache Spark can be easily deployed on an Amazon EMR cluster in order to scale processing resources as deemded necessary, the original data is only for the month of April 2016 and it is already in the scale of 2-3 millions. Once this data pipeline is deployed on the cluster, the need for additional processing capability is guaranteed in order to cope with all the data; for example, one year worth of data could be in the range of 50 million rows. \n",

    "- In case the data was increased by one hundred times, I would scale the number of Apache Spark clusters by a factor of 10-100 depending on how often I need to update the data.\n",
    "- In case the data needs to be populated in a dashboard on a daily basis, I would use Apache Airflow to manage the data pipeline through a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that runs with a service level of agreement of 24 hours. I would also use enough workers in the DAG to ensure that the SLA is met.\n",
    "- If the database needs to be accessed by 100 people, I would first ensure that my Spark cluster (for example, Amazon EMR) is configured with the right IAM (Identity Access Management) roles and user groups so that the 100 have access. Moreover, I would ensure that the cluster has enough workers to serve all the users with an acceptable latency."
