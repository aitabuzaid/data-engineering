    "#### Project Summary\n",
    "This project uses immigration data to the United States, combined with three other data sources, namely, historical averages of weather temperatures, airports in the US, and demographics of US cities in order to create a data lake through Spark that is ready for analysis when required. The project will provide a data model in a star schema with one fact and three dimensional tables. "

    "#### Scope \n",
    "The project will combine four data sources: I94 Immigration Data, World Temperature Data, US City Demographic Data, and Airport Code Table. I will use Spark in order to build a data lake and model the data in a star schema, with the I94 immigration data as the fact table and all other data sources as the dimension tables. The tables will be saved as parquet files as the end solution will be a set of parquet files that can be loaded whenever a new analysis is needed by the Data Science team. The only tool that will be used in this project is Apache Spark. Amazon EMR and Apache Airflow will not be used in this project, however, the project can be extended later on to include these technologies once the processing requirements increase. \n",

    "The fact table is the immigration data from the US National Tourism and Trade Office, detailing the respondents information (people travelling into the US), while the dimension tables are as follows: the first provides the average temperature for cities in the world and it is provided by Kaggle datasets, the second provides detailed information about city airports in the US, and it is provided from DataHub, while the last provides further details about demographics in US cities, and it is provided from OpenSoft. The three data sets will be joined through taking cities as the primary key.\n",

    "Sample queries that the final data model will be able to answer:\n",

    " -How does immigration differ in terms of visa type and the origin country? \n",

    " -What is the correlation between the type of airport and the number of people visiting a city? \n",
